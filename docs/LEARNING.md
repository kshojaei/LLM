# Learning Guide

How to learn RAG systems using this project.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Build a working RAG system that can answer questions using retrieved documents.

## ðŸ“š Learning Path

### Week 1: Foundations
1. **Notebook 1**: Understand what RAG is and why it works
2. **Notebook 2**: Collect real data (Wikipedia, ArXiv)

### Week 2: Data Processing  
3. **Notebook 3**: Create embeddings from text
4. **Notebook 4**: Chunk text into searchable pieces

### Week 3: Search & Retrieval
5. **Notebook 5**: Build vector similarity search
6. **Notebook 6**: Implement hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse)

### Week 4: Generation & Evaluation
7. **Notebook 7**: Connect LLMs for answer generation
8. **Notebook 8**: Measure how well your system works

### Week 5: Production
9. **Notebook 9**: Optimize and deploy your system

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LLM.git
   cd LLM
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Open Jupyter Lab**: `http://localhost:8888`

3. **Start with**: `01_understanding_rag.ipynb`

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Tips

- **Run every cell** - Don't just read, execute the code
- **Experiment** - Change parameters and see what happens
- **Take notes** - Document what you learn
- **Ask questions** - Use GitHub issues for help
- **Build variations** - Try different approaches

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

You'll know you're learning when you can:
- Explain why RAG works better than pure LLMs
- Build a vector database from your own data
- Retrieve relevant documents for any question
- Generate accurate answers using retrieved context
- Deploy your system and share it with others

## ðŸ†˜ Getting Help

- **GitHub Issues**: Ask specific questions
- **Documentation**: Check the `docs/` folder
- **Code Comments**: Read the source code
- **Community**: Share your progress and learnings

**Focus on understanding, not just getting code to run!** ðŸš€
