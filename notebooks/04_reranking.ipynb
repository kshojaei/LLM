    "## Introduction to Reranking\n",
    "\n",
    "While basic vector similarity works well for initial retrieval, production RAG systems often use reranking to improve result quality. This notebook focuses on reranking techniques that can significantly improve search relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Reranking?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Two-Stage Process**: Fast initial retrieval followed by sophisticated reranking\n",
    "- **Cross-Encoders**: Models that see both query and document together\n",
    "- **Quality Improvement**: Often provides 15-30% better results\n",
    "- **Trade-off**: Better quality at the cost of increased latency\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "1. Understand how reranking works and why it's effective\n",
    "2. Implement a two-stage retrieval system\n",
    "3. Learn about cross-encoder models and their advantages\n",
    "4. Understand the performance vs quality trade-offs\n",
